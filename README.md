## Background

This project is a cooperation between the Open WebTech and VirtualValley communities:

 - VirtualValley AI: http://invite.virtualvalley.ai
 - Open WebTech: https://owta.dev/discord

## Goal

The idea is very simple:

 - We want to democratize model training and AI research.
 - Let's make it simple to share compute power!
